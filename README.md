Q1: AI-driven code generation tools
How they reduce development time:

Auto-complete repetitive code patterns and boilerplate
Generate function implementations from comments/signatures
Suggest entire code blocks for common tasks
Reduce context switching and documentation lookup

Limitations:

Generated code may have bugs or security vulnerabilities
Can produce inefficient or non-optimal solutions
May not understand full business context or requirements
Risk of developers becoming over-reliant and losing coding skills

Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised learning for bug detection
Supervised learning:

Trained on labeled datasets of known bugs and clean code
Learns to identify specific bug patterns it's seen before
More accurate for known vulnerability types
Requires extensive labeled training data

Unsupervised learning:

Detects anomalies and unusual patterns without prior bug examples
Can find novel or unknown bug types
Less accurate but better at discovering new vulnerability classes
Doesn't need pre-labeled bug datasets

Q3: Bias mitigation in UX personalization
Why it's critical:

Biased algorithms can create discriminatory user experiences
May reinforce existing inequalities (e.g., showing different opportunities based on demographics)
Can create filter bubbles that limit user exposure to diverse content
Legal and ethical obligations to ensure fair treatment of all users
Poor personalization can damage brand reputation and user trust
